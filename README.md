Linear Algebra fundamentals and concepts are the key foundation for machine learning and Artificial Intelligence that provide real-life applications. One of the main concepts is the least squares. The least squares method is an approach to finding the best fit of plotted data in a curve, so it would predict future events. Our project aims to use linear regression, as a machine learning algorithm that analyzes time-series data and expects the upcoming via least squares. Using time-series data sets of traffic jams, we would apply the concept to forecast congestion.
